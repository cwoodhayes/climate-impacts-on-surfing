    abstract = { AbstractPast and future changes in the Aleutian low are investigated by using observation-based sea level pressure (SLP) datasets and CMIP5 models. It is found that the Aleutian low intensity, measured by the North Pacific Index (NPI), has significantly strengthened during the twentieth century, with the observed centennial trend double the modeled counterpart for the multimodel average of historical simulations, suggesting compound signals of anthropogenic warming and natural variability. As climate warms under the strongest future warming scenario, the climatological-mean Aleutian low will continue to intensify and expand northward, as manifested in the significant decrease (−1.3 hPa) of the multimodel-averaged NPI, which is 1.6 times its unforced internal variability, and the increase in the central area of low pressure (SLP < 999.0 hPa), which expands about 7 times that in the twentieth century. A suite of idealized experiments further demonstrates that the deepening of the Aleutian low can be driven by an El Niño–like warming of the tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST), with a reduction in the climatological-mean zonal SST gradient, which overshadows the dampening effect of a weakened wintertime land–ocean thermal contrast on the Aleutian low change in a warmer climate. While the projected deepening of Aleutian low on multimodel average is robust, individual model portrayals vary primarily in magnitude. Intermodel difference in surface warming amplitude over the Asian continent, which is found to explain about 31\% of the variance of the NPI changes across models, has a greater contribution than that in the spatial pattern of tropical Pacific SST warming (which explains about 23\%) to model uncertainty in the projection of Aleutian low intensity. },

    abstract = { AbstractFocusing on ENSO seasonal phase locking, diversity in peak location, and propagation direction, as well as the El Niño–La Niña asymmetry in amplitude, duration, and transition, a set of empirical probabilistic diagnostics (EPD) is introduced to investigate how the ENSO behaviors reflected in SST may change in a warming climate.EPD is first applied to estimate the natural variation of ENSO behaviors. In the observations El Niños and La Niñas mainly propagate westward and peak in boreal winter. El Niños occur more at the eastern Pacific whereas La Niñas prefer the central Pacific. In a preindustrial control simulation of the GFDL CM2.1 model, the El Niño–La Niña asymmetry is substantial. La Niña characteristics generally agree with observations but El Niño’s do not, typically propagating eastward and showing no obvious seasonal phase locking. So an alternative approach is using a stochastically forced simulation of a nonlinear data-driven model, which exhibits reasonably realistic ENSO behaviors and natural variation ranges.EPD is then applied to assess the potential changes of ENSO behaviors in the twenty-first century using CMIP5 models. Other than the increasing SST climatology, projected changes in many aspects of ENSO reflected in SST anomalies are heavily model dependent and generally within the range of natural variation. Shifts favoring eastward-propagating El Niño and La Niña are the most robust. Given various model biases for the twentieth century and lack of sufficient model agreements for the twenty-first-century projection, whether the projected changes for ENSO behaviors would actually take place remains largely uncertain. },

abstract = {Abstract We downscale Santa Ana winds (SAWs) from eight global climate models (GCMs) and validate key aspects of their climatology over the historical period. We then assess SAW evolution and behavior through the 21st century, paying special attention to changes in their extreme occurrences. All GCMs project decreases in SAW activity, starting in the early 21st century, which are commensurate with decreases in the southwestward pressure gradient force that drives these winds. The trend is most pronounced in the early and late SAW season: fall and spring. It is mainly determined by changes in the frequency of SAW events, less so by changes in their intensity. The peak of the SAW season (November–December–January) is least affected by anthropogenic climate change in GCM projections.},,

	abstract = {Climate warming has produced stronger winds along some coasts, a result of growing differences in temperature and pressure between land and sea. These winds cause cold nutrient-rich seawater to rise to the surface, affecting climate and fueling marine productivity. Sydeman et al. examined data from the five major world regions where upwelling is occurring. Particularly in the California, Humboldt, and Benguela upwelling systems, winds have become stronger over the past 60 years. These regions represent up to a fifth of wild marine fish catches and are hot spots of biodiversity.Science, this issue p. 77 In 1990, Andrew Bakun proposed that increasing greenhouse gas concentrations would force intensification of upwelling-favorable winds in eastern boundary current systems that contribute substantial services to society. Because there is considerable disagreement about whether contemporary wind trends support Bakun{\textquoteright}s hypothesis, we performed a meta-analysis of the literature on upwelling-favorable wind intensification. The preponderance of published analyses suggests that winds have intensified in the California, Benguela, and Humboldt upwelling systems and weakened in the Iberian system over time scales ranging up to 60 years; wind change is equivocal in the Canary system. Stronger intensification signals are observed at higher latitudes, consistent with the warming pattern associated with climate change. Overall, reported changes in coastal winds, although subtle and spatially variable, support Bakun{\textquoteright}s hypothesis of upwelling intensification in eastern boundary current systems.},
